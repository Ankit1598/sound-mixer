## Inspiration
Ever wanted to lead your own choir? Want to be a sound mixer? Wanted to generate music just by your moving your hands?
Its not some magic! ! 

## What it does
It determines what hand gesture you are making from the American Sign Language and plays music corresponding to each of them.

## How we built it
- First, we made a webapp using React js with a cool Music Visualizer.
- Developed a Deep Learning model using Cognitive Services.
- Integrated the model with webapp and made an API for the same.
- Added the Keyboard Music Player.

## Challenges we ran into
- Experienced great difficult in sending the image from the frontend to the API as API accepted only URLs 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Even though in the 24hr hackathon, we made an awesome interface with an authentication system.
- Developed a Highly accurate Deep Learning model and trained over a data of thousands of images.
- We managed the work very well right from the team formation to the providing the MVP.

## What we learned
- About postman API.
- Conversion of Image to DataURL and vice versa

## What's next for Sound Mixer
- At moment, it works on images(kept due to less number of Cloud credits). When brought commercially with huge number of cloud credits, can be expanded to videos as well.
